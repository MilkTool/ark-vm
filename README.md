# mac-ark
This is my virtual machine [mac](//github.com/felixangell/mac) implemented
in the Ark programming language.

Note that because Ark is in development constantly, this can break at any
time, consider it a more realistic unit test against Ark. 

This probably wont work properly for some time.
